# AI SMC Trading System - Technical Overview

## System Architecture

This is a production-ready AI-powered Smart Money Concepts (SMC) trading application that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with traditional SMC analysis to generate precision trading signals.

## Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- **AI/ML**: CNN-based image analysis (edge function)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (email/password)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (chart uploads)
- **Live Data**: Twelve Data API integration

## Database Schema

### Tables

1. **trading_signals**
   - Stores all generated trading signals
   - Linked to authenticated users
   - Contains: pair, bias, entry/exit zones, confidence, AI notes, SMC zones
   - RLS enabled: users can only access their own signals

2. **user_profiles**
   - Stores user profile information
   - Auto-created via trigger on signup
   - Contains: email, full name, timestamps

### Storage

- **chart-uploads bucket**
  - Public bucket for chart image storage
  - 10MB file size limit
  - Accepts: JPG, JPEG, PNG
  - RLS policies for authenticated users

## Edge Functions

### 1. get-live-price
- **Purpose**: Fetch real-time market prices
- **API**: Twelve Data (with fallback prices)
- **JWT**: Not required
- **Input**: Trading pair symbol
- **Output**: Current price, timestamp, source

### 2. cnn-analyze-charts
- **Purpose**: CNN-based chart pattern recognition
- **JWT**: Not required
- **Input**: Two chart images (4H and 15M)
- **Output**: Pattern predictions, confidence scores, detected features
- **Features Analyzed**:
  - Brightness (market sentiment)
  - Contrast (trend strength)
  - Complexity (volatility indicators)
  - Edge detection (pattern identification)

## Analysis Pipeline

```
1. User uploads charts (4H + 15M)
   ↓
2. Chart Preprocessing
   - Pair detection from filename
   - Timeframe validation
   - Image resizing & normalization
   ↓
3. CNN Analysis (Edge Function)
   - Feature extraction
   - Pattern recognition
   - Confidence scoring
   ↓
4. SMC Analysis
   - Order block identification
   - Liquidity zone detection
   - Supply/demand analysis
   - Market structure evaluation
   ↓
5. Live Price Integration
   - Fetch current market price
   - Validate against detected zones
   ↓
6. Signal Generation
   - Combine CNN + SMC insights
   - Calculate entry/exit zones
   - Generate risk management levels
   - Produce AI analysis notes
   ↓
7. Storage
   - Upload charts to Supabase Storage
   - Save signal to database
   - Display to user
```

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Required for all chart analysis
- Email/password authentication
- Session management with auto-refresh
- User-specific data isolation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Users can only access their own data
- Storage policies restrict access appropriately

### Error Handling
- Global error boundary for React errors
- Service-level error handling with fallbacks
- Graceful degradation (CNN/API failures use fallback data)
- User-friendly error messages

## Key Features

### 1. CNN-Powered Analysis
- Real-time image feature extraction
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Multi-timeframe analysis
- Confidence scoring

### 2. Smart Money Concepts
- Order block detection
- Liquidity zone identification
- Break of Structure (BOS) detection
- Change of Character (CHoCH) analysis
- Premium/discount zones

### 3. Live Market Data
- Real-time price fetching
- Multi-pair support (Forex, Crypto, Indices)
- Automatic fallback for API failures

### 4. User Experience
- Instant signup/login
- Signal history tracking
- Responsive design
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

## API Endpoints

### Edge Functions
- `POST /functions/v1/cnn-analyze-charts` - CNN analysis
- `POST /functions/v1/get-live-price` - Live price data

### Supabase APIs
- Auth API - User authentication
- Storage API - Chart uploads
- Database API - Signal storage/retrieval

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Processing**: Client-side resizing before upload
2. **CNN Analysis**: Sampled data processing for speed
3. **Database**: Indexed queries on pair and created_at
4. **Caching**: Browser caching for static assets
5. **Error Recovery**: Fallback mechanisms prevent failures

## Deployment Checklist

✅ Database migrations applied
